# My Advent of Code solutions 

This repository contains my solutions for the different puzzles of the https://adventofcode.com/.
You can find all the info in the website, but basically each year from December 1st to December 25th there is a new challenge/puzzle that you have to resolve whatever you like most.
There are also videos (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS9882S0ZHs) of talks of the site creator with a more in depth explanation. 


## Basic info

#### Repository structure
The repository is organized by year and day:
```bash
.
├── 2022
│   ├── day1
│   ├── day2
│   ├── day3
│   ├── day4
│   ├── day5
│   ├── day6
│   └── README.md
├── 2023
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
```
As you can see each year will contain a specific README.md file.

Each day folder will contain the input and the solutions of that day. For now, the day folder structure is like that:
```bash
day1
├── input_1.txt
├── script_1.py
└── script_2.py
```

#### Instructions
To run solution scripts you must enter to each day folder and run scripts from there.


#### TODO
- Rethink repo structure. It would be nice to have some automation for the boilerplate code and structure of each day and so.
- In that way, it would be good to think for a common structure for all the days for 2023.
- Add some automations too with git hooks like automate code style commands with black before each commit and so.
- Try to resolve the challenges with ruby or javascript.
